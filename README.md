# Requirement Analysis in Software Development

This repository contains a comprehensive breakdown of the Requirement Analysis phase in the Software Development Lifecycle (SDLC), using a Booking Management System as a case study. It includes key concepts, structured documentation, diagrams, and examples that demonstrate how to gather, document, and validate software requirements effectively.

## What is Requirement Analysis?

Requirement Analysis is a critical phase in the Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) that involves identifying, documenting, and analyzing the needs and expectations of stakeholders for a new or modified software system. It serves as the foundation for all subsequent stages of development by ensuring a clear understanding of what the system is expected to achieve.

This process helps developers and stakeholders align their goals, minimize misunderstandings, and set realistic expectations. It also reduces the risk of project failure by preventing scope creep and identifying potential challenges early in the development process.

In summary, Requirement Analysis answers the fundamental question: **"What does the user need the system to do?"**
