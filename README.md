# Requirement Analysis in Software Development

This repository contains a comprehensive breakdown of the Requirement Analysis phase in the Software Development Lifecycle (SDLC), using a Booking Management System as a case study. It includes key concepts, structured documentation, diagrams, and examples that demonstrate how to gather, document, and validate software requirements effectively.

## What is Requirement Analysis?

Requirement Analysis is a critical phase in the Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) that involves identifying, documenting, and analyzing the needs and expectations of stakeholders for a new or modified software system. It serves as the foundation for all subsequent stages of development by ensuring a clear understanding of what the system is expected to achieve.

This process helps developers and stakeholders align their goals, minimize misunderstandings, and set realistic expectations. It also reduces the risk of project failure by preventing scope creep and identifying potential challenges early in the development process.

In summary, Requirement Analysis answers the fundamental question: **"What does the user need the system to do?"**


## Why is Requirement Analysis Important?

Requirement Analysis plays a crucial role in the success of any software development project. Here are three key reasons why it's important:

- **Prevents Miscommunication:**  
  By clearly defining the expectations of stakeholders, Requirement Analysis ensures that everyone involved in the project has a shared understanding of the systemâ€™s goals and functionality.

- **Saves Time and Resources:**  
  Identifying and resolving ambiguities early helps avoid costly changes and rework during development and testing phases.

- **Improves Product Quality:**  
  With well-defined requirements, developers can build a system that meets user needs effectively, resulting in a more usable and reliable product.


## Key Activities in Requirement Analysis

Requirement Analysis involves several essential activities that ensure software requirements are properly identified, documented, and validated. These activities include:

- **Requirement Gathering:**  
  Collecting information from stakeholders, end-users, and other relevant sources about what they expect from the system.

- **Requirement Elicitation:**  
  Using techniques like interviews, surveys, brainstorming sessions, and workshops to uncover implicit and explicit needs.

- **Requirement Documentation:**  
  Clearly recording the gathered requirements in structured formats such as Software Requirement Specifications (SRS), user stories, or use cases.

- **Requirement Analysis and Modeling:**  
  Analyzing the documented requirements to resolve conflicts, remove ambiguities, and model the system using diagrams or other visual tools.

- **Requirement Validation:**  
  Ensuring that the documented requirements are accurate, complete, and aligned with stakeholder expectations through reviews, walkthroughs, or prototyping.
